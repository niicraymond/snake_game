- Keyboard controls (arrow keys)

- High score tracking stored locally in the browser  

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Any modern browser (desktop or mobile)  
- No server required; can be opened directly or hosted (e.g., GitHub Pages)

### Running Locally

1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open the HTML file in your browser

## Gameplay

- Eat the üçé to grow longer. Each apple increases your score by 1.  
- Don‚Äôt run into the walls or your own body‚Äîdoing so ends the game.  
- High score is saved between sessions.

## High Score

The game remembers your highest score locally. On game over:
- If you beat your previous high score, it‚Äôs updated and celebrated.  
- Otherwise you‚Äôre shown your current score and the stored high score.

To reset the high score manually (open browser console):
```js
localStorage.removeItem("snakeHighScore");
